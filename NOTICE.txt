Python Script Summary
This Python script processes events from a file named "DumpFile.txt," extracts specific information, generates a CSV file, analyzes IP addresses, creates graphs, and converts the CSV to Markdown and HTML. The code can be summarized as follows:

File Reading:

Reads the contents of "DumpFile.txt" and splits it into lines.
CSV File Initialization:

Creates a CSV file named "test.csv" to store extracted data.
Data Extraction:

Iterates through events in "DumpFile.txt" that start with "11:42".
Extracts various fields from each event, such as date, source IP, port, destination IP, flag, sequence number, acknowledgment number, window size, options, and length.
Writes the extracted data to the CSV file.
IP Address Analysis:

Tracks the frequency of occurrence for each unique source IP address.
Top IP Addresses:

Identifies the two most frequent source IP addresses.
Filtering Events:

Selects events related to the top two IP addresses and writes them to the CSV file.
CSV to Markdown and HTML Conversion:

Reads the CSV file into a NumPy array.
Converts the CSV data to Markdown format using the tabulate library.
Converts Markdown to HTML using the markdown2 library.
Saves the HTML content to a file named "test.html."
Graph Plotting:

Plots a graph using Matplotlib with unique source IP addresses on the x-axis.
Closing Files:

Closes the CSV file.
Additional Features:

Introduces a delay using time.sleep(1).
Handles potential errors during CSV data loading.
Dependencies:
The script relies on external libraries such as numpy, matplotlib, pypandoc, markdown2, and tabulate.
Note: The code is written in a mix of English and French. Consider translating all comments and variable names to English for consistency.
